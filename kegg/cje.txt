Rfam RF00059, TPP riboswitch (THI element) was identified within CDS. Vitamin B(1) in its active form thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) is an essential coenzyme that is synthesised by coupling of pyrimidine and thiazole moieties in bacteria. The previously detected thiamin-regulatory element, thi box (PMID:12376536) was extended, resulting in a new, highly conserved RNA secondary structure, the THI element. Analysis of operon structures identified a large number of new candidate thiamin-regulated genes, mostly transporters, in various prokaryotic organisms (PMID:1147090)
